      <h3>Visualizing education data in Kenya reveals a dynamic picture of the present situation as well as future challenges and opportunities.</h3>
      <p>With 50 percent of the population under the age of 18 it is increasingly important to increase education transparency as the country invests in these future leaders. Explore the site to see how resources are being used to reach Kenya's 2030 goal of creating “globally competitive, quality education and training for sustainable development”.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

			     <p>Kenya's 2009 census reported 74 percent of the population to have at least a primary education. However this statistic is lower in most arid and semi arid lands (ASAL) due to fewer school locations; 83 percent of the urban population has a primary education or higher compared to 70 percent in the rural areas.</p>
			     <p>Secondary schools are even less prevalent in the ASAL region, where there are also the highest <a data-layer='mayarichman.kenya_poverty' href='#' class='section-nam'>poverty rates</a> in the nation.</p>

            <div class='section'>
              <p>Poverty rates are highest in the north and southeast, where there are also less schools available. This educational and economic disadvantage creates an enormous challenge for enrollment and retention of children, especially girls, in these areas.

                <p>In Wajir, a district with an 84 percent poverty rate in the ASAL, family related reasons, such as 'Had to work or help at home' and economic reasons like 'No money for school costs', are frequently cited as the reason for never attending school.</p> <p>Regardless of the school location and public education ensured as a universal right, other school-related costs or a family"s economic insecurity can jeopardize the student attendance and retention.</p>

            <div class='section'>
              <p>High literacy rates throughout many districts are the result of a strong primary education system in Kenya. However, many gaps can be seen, with some literacy rates falling below 20 percent arid areas with lower populations. Predictably, literacy rates are higher where there is great <a href='#' >access to schools</a>. Areas such as West Pokot and Turkana may soon see an increase in literacy due to high <a data-layer='mayarichman.kenya_prim_exam_10' href='#'>2010 exam results</a>, which show strengthening local education.

              <p>Although students perform well on comparable standard competency tests to other sub-Saharan countries, the challenge remains to ensure that children are not only in school, but learning while there.</p>

            High investment is generally seen where there are also high exam results, except in the case of Samburu, and Garissa. Both counties invested less than $8,000 Kshs. per student, but saw some of the highest positive change in primary exam results from 2006 to 2010.</p>
            <p>Generally districts with high investment levels in secondary schools have growth in exam results from 2006 to 2010. However, Marsabit has the highest level of secondary school investment with a -9 percent change in secondary school exam results. These examples call for further transparency about investment practices.

              <p>The introduction of the universal primary education policy in 2003 has been very successful, net enrollment rates increased from 80 percent to 91 percent in 2010. Free basic education is a compulsory right, and according to the 2009 census 74 percent of the population has at least a primary education.</p>
            <p>Poverty remains a large factor in child enrollment and retention, and there is consistently high illiteracy in impoverished areas. This is especially true of arid and semi arid lands (ASAL), such as Wajir and Turkana in the north.</p>

              <p>The quality of education differs dramatically between public and private schools, with the average pupil-teacher ratio in public primary schools almost 3 times higher than private. 
                   
                  
                  Spending also has dramatic impacts on student-The four counties spending more than 11K per pupil also all have less than 30 students per teacher. </p>

    <h3>About the site</h3>      
	<p>The Exploring Kenyan Education site investigates the education sector in Kenya and visualizes location data for all primary and secondary schools across the country. By mapping school locations with education outcomes and investment data, the site provides insight into the state of education within Kenya.</p>
	<h3>Methodology</h3>
	<p>Data work was carried out to join attribute data with spatial data for the purpose of visualization. Data was obtained and collected from the Kenya OpenData portal () and official Government of Kenya data. In cases of pre-2010 data, district names were updated to the 2010 designated 47 counties. Data was aggregated and formatted into county-level tables and joined to county-level geographic data. Averages, minimums, and maximums were calculated to be included in the visualization.</p>
