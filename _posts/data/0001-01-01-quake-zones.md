This layer depicts areas of risk based on the 1956 version of the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI) describing potential damage along with a 20 percent probability the maximum likely intensity of an event will be exceeded in 50 years.  Five categories of intensity are shown - Level 1 is light cream colored and corresponds to an MMI of less than IV.  Level 5 is dark red or most intense and corresponds to an MMI of greater than IX.  Data was provided by the [United Nations Environmental Programme/Global Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID)](http://geodata.grid.unep.ch). Additional information about the MMI Scale is provided by the [USGS](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/mag_vs_int.php). Data obtained October 26, 2011.
