<p>The grades database was joined to the 2007 schools database, provided by Ministry of Education and made accessible by the Kenya openData portal, in order to obtain location information. Due to differences in database structure and school reporting conventions, not every school could be joined. The percentages and totals shown on the map are grouped by the Kenyan National Education Council (KNEC) code.
