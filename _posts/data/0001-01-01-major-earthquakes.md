<p>This layer depicts earthquake events since 1990 that either caused at least one fatality or had a moment magnitude (MW) of 7 or greater. The MW magnitude is the physical quantity proportional to the slip on the fault times the area of the fault surface that slips. A measure of seismic energy, MS, is displayed where the MW value is unavailable. Data was downloaded from the <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/form?t=101650&amp;s=1&amp;d=1">Significant Earthquake Database</a> of the <a href="http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/ngdc.html">National Geophysical Data Center</a>. Data obtained October 26, 2011.</p>
