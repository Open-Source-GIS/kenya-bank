      <h3>Visualizing education data in Kenya reveals a dynamic picture of the present situation as well as future challenges and opportunities.</h3>
      <p>With 50 percent of the population under the age of 18 it is increasingly important to increase education transparency as the country invests in these future leaders. Explore the site to see how resources are being used to reach Kenya's 2030 goal of creating “globally competitive, quality education and training for sustainable development”.<sup>[1]</sup></p>

			     <p>Kenya's 2009 census reported 74 percent of the population to have at least a primary education. However this statistic is lower in most arid and semi arid lands (ASAL) due to fewer school locations; 83 percent of the urban population has a primary education or higher compared to 70 percent in the rural areas.</p>
			     <p>Secondary schools are even less prevalent in the ASAL region, where there are also the highest <a href='#' class='narrative' data-which-narrative='2'>poverty rates</a> in the nation.</p>

            <div class='section'>
              <p>Poverty rates are highest in the north and southeast, where there are also less schools available. This educational and economic disadvantage creates an enormous challenge for enrollment and retention of children, especially girls, in these areas. See the most common reasons <a href='#' class='narrative' data-which-narrative='3'>keeping children from school</a>.</p>

            <div class='section'>
                <p>In Wajir, a district with an 84 percent poverty rate in the ASAL, family related reasons, such as 'Had to work or help at home' and economic reasons like 'No money for school costs', are frequently cited as the reason for never attending school.</p> <p>Regardless of the school location and public education ensured as a universal right, other school-related costs or a family"s economic insecurity can jeopardize the student attendance and retention.</p>
                <p>These factors directly affect school performance.</p>

            <div class='section'>
              <p>High literacy rates throughout many districts are the result of a strong primary education system. However, many gaps can be seen, with some literacy rates falling below 20 percent in arid areas with lower populations. Predictably, literacy rates are higher where there is greater access to schools.</p>Areas such as West Pokot and Turkana may soon see an increase in literacy due to high <a href='#' class='narrative' data-which-narrative='5'>2010 exam results</a>, highlighting improved local education.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>Districts in the north west performed considerably well on primary exams, which contrasts their relatively low literacy rates and investment per capita in education.</p>
              
              <p>Over the last four years, there has not been a significant improvement in the national mean <a href='#' class='narrative' data-which-narrative='6'>exam scores</a>.</p>

             <p>Some districts, such as Sambaru, saw strong percent increases in scores for both primary and secondary schools. This growth is observed in most districts for primary schools, however there has not been nearly as much improvement in the national mean score on the secondary level exams.</p>

              </ul>
            <p>High investment is generally seen where there are also high exam results, except in the case of Samburu, and Garissa. Both counties invested less than $8,000 Kshs. per student, but saw some of the highest positive change in primary exam results from 2006 to 2010.</p>
            <p>Districts with high investment levels in secondary schools generally have growth in exam results from 2006 to 2010. However, Marsabit has the highest level of secondary school investment, but also had a -9 percent change in secondary school exam results. Understanding these examples requires further data, such as <a href='#' class='narrative' data-which-narrative='7'>student enrollment.</p>

              </ul>
              <p>The introduction of the universal primary education policy in 2003 has been very successful, net enrollment rates increased from 80 percent to 91 percent in 2010. Free basic education is a compulsory right, and according to the 2009 census 74 percent of the population has at least a primary education.</p>
            <p>Yet ensuring students are learning remains a challenge once students are in class. Factors such as <a href='#'class='narrative'  data-which-narrative='8'>pupil-teacher ratios</a> determine the effectiveness of their education.</p>
            </div>
          </li>

            <a href='#' data-narrative='8' data-layer='worldbank-education.kenya_ptr_prim' class='section-name'>Pupil-Teacher Ratio</a>

              </ul>
              <p>The quality of education differs dramatically between public and private schools, with the average pupil-teacher ratio in public primary schools almost 3 times higher than private. High student to pupil ratios is seen where there are poor exam results, such as in Bungoma where the average ratio is 65 pupils per teacher, and primary school exam averages went down by 6 percent in the last four years.</p> 
                 <p> Spending also has dramatic impacts on pupil teacher ratios. The four counties spending more than 11K per pupil also all have less than 30 students per teacher. </p>

    <h3>About the site</h3>      
	<p>The Exploring Kenyan Education site investigates the education sector in Kenya and visualizes location data for all primary and secondary schools across the country. By mapping school locations with education outcomes and investment data, the site provides insight into the state of education within Kenya.</p>
	<h3>Methodology</h3>
	<p>Data work was carried out using OpenOffice and SQLite to join attribute data with spatial data for the purpose of visualization. Data was obtained and collected from the <a href="https://opendata.go.ke/">Kenya OpenData portal</a> and official Government of Kenya data. In cases of pre-2010 data, district names were updated to the 47 2010-designated counties. Data was aggregated and formatted into county-level tables and joined to county-level geographic data. Averages, minimums, and maximums were calculated to be included in the visualization.</p> 
	<p>School location data was downloaded from the Kenya OpenData portal. Latitude and longitude data for 37,725 primary and secondary schools were reformatted for proper use in mapping applications. All points were plotted on the map, including schools that are listed with zero enrollment. It is unknown to whether these locations have invalid data, missing data, or are closed.</p> 
	<p>Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exam results were obtained from the Kenyan National Examination Council. Exam results were listed by school with gender and score categorizations. Percentages of students passing (C+ or higher for secondary, or a score higher than 250 for primary) were calculated for both the KCPE and the KCSE exam results. Results were aggregated to county-level averages. The exam results only contained county location identifiers and did not include a national school identifier code so only county-level aggregations were able to be visualized.</p>
	<p>Other contextual data was obtained from the Kenya OpenData portal. Data was matched to county administrative geographic data by county name. There is no official source of county administrative boundary geographic data. This site used county geographic data made publicly available on ArcGIS.com.</p>
	<p>All maps were created with <a href="http://mapbox.com/tilemill">TileMill</a> and hosted with <a href="http://mapbox.com">MapBox</a>. Color scales were determined based on natural breaks within each of the visualized indicators.</p>
