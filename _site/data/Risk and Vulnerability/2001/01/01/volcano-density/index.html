<p>This layer depicts the density of volcanic eruption risk based on a measure of intensity of eruption, the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) as derived by the Pacific Disaster Center. Areas of risk are based on a 100km density marking areas potentially affected by volcanic emissions or ground shaking. Data was adapted from the <a href="http://www.volcano.si.edu/index.cfm">Smithsonian Institution's Global Volcanism Program</a> and provided by the Pacific Disaster Center, see <a href="http://www.pdc.org/mde/full_metadata.jsp?docId={C96D526C-3EEF-41AA-8204-F52091250A51}">here</a> for a full process description.
