<p>This layer depicts major flood locations made available by the Dartmouth Flood Observatory. Flood locations are derived from a variety of sources including news, governmental sources, instrumental reports, and remote sensing methods. Flood locations on the map are displayed with a flood magnitude index greater than or equal to 6 (Flood Magnitude Index = LOG(Duration x Severity X Affected Area)). Data was processed to show centroid locations of major flood events and do not show extent or amount of affected area.  Data was downloaded from the <a href="http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/">Global Active Archive of Large Flood Events</a> made available by the <a href="http://floodobservatory.colorado.edu/">Dartmouth Flood Observatory, University of Colorado</a>. Data obtained October 26, 2011.</p>
