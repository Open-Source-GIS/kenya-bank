<p>This layer depicts earthquake events since 1990 that either caused at least one fatality or had a moment magnitude (MW) of 7 or greater. The MW magnitude is the physical quantity proportional to the slip on the fault times the area of the fault surface that slips. A measure of seismic energy, MS, is displayed where the MW value is unavailable.
